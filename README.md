# Homework 4- due date 3/14/21
## For this homework I attempted to write the neccessary code using as few lines of code as possible. 

* I was able to generate a styling I enjoyed, and a timer that started and decremented with incorrect answers.
* The questions ans answer function works while the styling is not complete, nor do the questions hide prior to the quiz.
* Unfortunately , I spent to much of the week, approaching how I was going to do this assignment and not simply coding it and the results show this indecisiveness.
